# Object Localisation 📦🔎
A Computer Vision project (LOK_1) to mark objects with a bounding box as close-fitting as possible.

## Setup Guide 🛠️
### Setup local dev environment on Linux/Mac:

After you've successfully setup this project as your template repository, check if python is
available `python3 --version` and `python3 -m pip --version`.
Both statements should return a version number!

Set up a python environment to install all necessary packages locally. In case you don't have virtualenv yet, type `python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv`.
For this you can type `python3 -m venv venv`.
You activate the environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.

Now you can install all necessary libraries with `pip install -r
requirements.txt`.

### Setup local dev environment on Windows:

After you've successfully setup this project as your template repository, check if python is
available `py --version` and `py -m pip --version`.
Both statements should return a version number!

Set up a python environment to install all necessary packages locally. In case you don't have virtualenv yet, type `py -m pip install --user virtualenv`.
For this you can type `py -m venv env`.
You activate the environment with `.\env\Scripts\activate`.

Now you can install all necessary libraries with `pip install -r
requirements.txt`.
